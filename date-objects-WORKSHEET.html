  		//Problem 1
  		//Create a date object by calling the Date constructor function, assign the object to a constant named 'today'.
  		//Invoke the getTime() method of 'today' and log the return value.
  		//Invoke the toDateString() method of 'today' and log the return value.



  		//Problem 2
  		// Use the Date() constructor function to create a date object that represents your birthday.
  		// Pass in parameters to the constructor function to set the date object to your birthday.
  		// Assign the returned object in a constant called 'myBirthday'
  		// BE CAREFUL: Month numbers start with 0, not 1
  		// Then log the date so that it's easy to read your birthday (use the toDateString() method)



  		//Problem 3
  		// Use the Date constructor function without any parameters to create a date object.
  		// You can store the return object in a constant called 'newYearsEve'.
  		// Then use various methods of the object to set the date to December 31 of the current year.
  		// HINT: you will have to use the following methods: setFullYear(), setMonth(), setDate()

  		
  		// Problem 4
  		// Write a function that converts milliseconds to days
  		// The function should have a parameter that represents a number of millisceconds
  		// The function should return the equivalent number in days


  		// Problem 5
  		// Use the today constant from problem 1 and the newYearsEve constant from problem 3
  		// to figure out how many days from now until newYearsEve.
  		// Hint, figure out the difference in milliseconds, and then use the function that you wrote
  		// for problem 4 to convert the milliseconds to days


  		// Bonus Problem
  		// Use various methods of the Date object to determine the significance of the specialDay variable below
  		// Then log a message that explains what day it is
  		var specialDay = new Date(-6106004517529); 




  		// Bonus Problem
  		// Write a function called getDayOfWeek(). 
  		// Include a parameter that represents a date object.
  		// The function should return the day name of the parameter
  		// (for example: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday)
  		// When you are done, test the function (pass in today's date), and log the return value
