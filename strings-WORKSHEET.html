						Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, 
						can long endure. 
						We are met on a great battle-field of that war. 
						We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, 
						as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. 
						It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.`;

		// If the includes() method returns true, then you have found another vowel)

		// to account for this (luckily there are string methods that can change the capitalizion)
